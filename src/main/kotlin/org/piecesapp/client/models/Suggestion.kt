 * This is the model return by the connector's suggest endpoint.  Note: assets are the assets that this target was ran against.  distribution is the distribution that we generated from comparing the target to the asset's vectors.(currently uuid(assetid) : value that is the difference between the asset and the target) **could potentially make an additional model here that is an array from most to least relevent.  *** distribution is required but we are currently unable to reflect that with our current dart generation.
