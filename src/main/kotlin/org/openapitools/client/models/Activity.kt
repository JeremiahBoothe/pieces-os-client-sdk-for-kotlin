/**
 * consider a rename to Event? That being said if we go with event we need to think about a word to pre/post fix event because it is likely to be a reserved word.  additional documentation: https://www.notion.so/getpieces/Activity-4da8de193733441f85f87b510235fb74   Notes: - user/asset/format are all optional, NOT required that one of these are present. - if mechanism == internal we will not display to the user.  Thoughts around additional properties. - hmm dismissed array here, that is an array of strings, where the string is the userId that dismissed this notification? or we could potentially do it based on the os_ID. -
